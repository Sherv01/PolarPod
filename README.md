# Bias Buster

Media bias is a persistent issue â€“Â when every source gives you a different perspective, how do you know which one to believe?
We created Bias Buster to help you responsibly consume news media by identifying and separating left and right wing biases. We collect the latest articles from various sources and provide bullet-point summaries of left, right and center viewpoints.

In today's overstimulated, short-form content driven world, our attention spans are constantly under attack. We know, we've been there too. So we've added a brainrot generator, a tool that lets you keep up with current news while catering to your short attention span.
